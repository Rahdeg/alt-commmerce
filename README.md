### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

### Built with

- **React 19** - Latest React version with improved performance
- **Next.js 15** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - For type safety and better development experience
- **Tailwind CSS 4** - Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Shadcn** - Accessible, unstyled UI components
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful & consistent icon set
- **Class Variance Authority (CVA)** - For creating type-safe component variants
- **Local Storage** - For persistent cart functionality
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach with desktop enhancements

### What I learned

This project helped me deepen my understanding of several key concepts:

**State Management with React Hooks**: Managing complex cart state across multiple components using useState and useEffect, along with localStorage for persistence.

```tsx
const [cartItems, setCartItems] = useState<CartItem[]>([]);
const [cartCount, setCartCount] = useState<number>(0);

useEffect(() => {
  const updateCart = () => {
    const storedCart = localStorage.getItem('cart');
    if (storedCart) {
      const cart: CartItem[] = JSON.parse(storedCart);
      setCartItems(cart);
      setCartCount(cart.reduce((total, item) => total + item.quantity, 0));
    }
  };
  
  window.addEventListener('cartUpdated', updateCart);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('cartUpdated', updateCart);
}, []);
```

**Advanced Image Gallery with Modal**: Creating an interactive image gallery with thumbnail navigation, keyboard controls, and a lightbox modal.

**Component Communication**: Using custom events to communicate between components for cart updates, ensuring data consistency across the application.

**Responsive Design with Tailwind**: Implementing mobile-first design with progressive enhancement for desktop, including different UI patterns for mobile vs desktop (mobile menu overlay vs desktop navigation).

### Continued development

Areas I want to continue focusing on in future projects:

- **Performance Optimization**: Implementing image optimization techniques, lazy loading, and code splitting for better performance
- **Accessibility**: Adding comprehensive ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support
- **Testing**: Writing unit tests and integration tests for components using Jest and React Testing Library
- **Animation**: Adding subtle animations and transitions using Framer Motion or CSS animations
- **State Management**: Exploring more complex state management solutions like Zustand or Redux Toolkit for larger applications
- **PWA Features**: Adding service workers for offline functionality and push notifications
